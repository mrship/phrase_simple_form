== Phrase / Simple Form integration test
  The app shows how the labels/placeholders don't 'walk the stack' of labels available to find the correct label, i.e.
  
    simple_form.labels.basic.edit.title, instead of finding simple_form.labels.basic.title
    
  when running without Phrase, SimpleForm finds the correct label.
  
  Also, editing the Basic object that is created through ```rake db:seed``` has a 27 second page generation when using Phrase.
  
  (just hit the home page to go to the edit form)
